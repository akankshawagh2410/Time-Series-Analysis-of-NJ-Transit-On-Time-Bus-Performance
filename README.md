# Time-Series-Analysis-of-NJ-Transit-On-Time-Bus-Performance

## üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes monthly Bus On-Time Performance (OTP) data from NJ Transit, spanning from **January 2009 to March 2025**, with the goal of **forecasting future performance** and uncovering seasonal trends. Using classical time series modeling techniques, we identified the **SARIMA model** as the best-fit approach for capturing both trend and seasonality.

## üìä Dataset Description

- **Source:** [NJ Transit Performance Data](https://www.njtransit.com/performance-data-download)  
- **Time Range:** Jan 2009 ‚Äì Mar 2025  
- **Columns:**
  - `OTP_YEAR`: Year of record  
  - `OTP_MONTH`: Month of record  
  - `OTP`: On-Time Performance (%)  
  - `TOTAL_TRIPS`: Total bus trips per month  
  - `TOTAL_LATES`: Number of late trips per month

## üîç Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Time series plots of OTP, TOTAL_TRIPS, and TOTAL_LATES
   - Identified key disruptions (e.g., COVID-19, weather patterns)

2. **Stationarity Testing**
   - ADF Test used before and after differencing
   - Differencing confirmed necessary for stationarity

3. **Model Identification**
   - ACF & PACF plots suggested ARIMA(2,1,1) and ARIMA(1,1,1) as candidates
   - Compared using AIC/BIC ‚Üí ARIMA(1,1,1) selected

4. **SARIMA Modeling**
   - Introduced seasonal component ‚Üí SARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1)[12]
   - Improved residual diagnostics and seasonality capture

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Residual analysis, ACF of residuals, Ljung-Box test, histogram, and QQ plot

6. **Forecasting**
   - 12-month forecast through March 2026
   - Projected OTP range: **88% ‚Äì 93%**

## ‚úÖ Key Insights

- **Seasonal Dips:** Recurring performance drops in early months due to operational/weather challenges.
- **Pandemic Impact:** Significant dip during 2020‚Äì2021; recovery seen post-2022.
- **Business Insight:** Forecast suggests an optimistic performance trend in late 2025, aligning with financial recovery reports from NJ Transit.
